%what is a protein-protein interaction network?
\section{The synapse and protein interaction}

Cells consist largely of proteins.
Each of these proteins are carefully tuned molecules which fit into machinery of a cell within the human body.
Functions of these cells include almost all cellular functions; there are proteins capable of pumping ions, reshaping DNA and fluorescing\cite{alberts_molecular_2008}.
A crude model of the cell is to map the interactions between these molecular machines to try to guess about the functioning of the cell.
These models are protein-protein interaction networks and can be useful to disease research.
