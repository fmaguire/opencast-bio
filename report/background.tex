%what is a protein-protein interaction network?
\section{The synapse and protein interaction}

%intro paragraph, why proteins are important
Cells consist largely of proteins.
Each of these proteins are carefully tuned molecules which fit into machinery of a cell within the human body.
Functions of these cells include almost all cellular functions; there are proteins capable of pumping ions, reshaping DNA and fluorescing\cite{alberts_molecular_2008}.
A crude model of the cell is to map the interactions between these molecular machines to try to guess about the functioning of the cell.
These models are protein-protein interaction networks and can be useful to disease research.

%going deeper, why do we care about proteins at the synapse, mention SYNSYS
The proteins at the synapse drive synaptic communication, which in turn defines the functioning of the brain.
As these proteins define the functioning of the brain any disorders which affect the brain are very likely to involve these proteins.
Disorders which affect the brain are also very common and poorly understood, affecting one in three people in the developed world\cite{citation_needed}.
Curing these diseases therefore may be possible through a greater understanding of the interactions of proteins at the synaptic level\cites{synsys,chua_architecture_2010}.
