\section{Data sources}
\label{datasources}

These data sources were gathered on the project wiki, which can be found here: \url{https://github.com/ggray1729/opencast-bio/wiki/Feature-extraction}.
The vast majority could not be included in the project due to time constraints but the list may be useful for future work.

\subsection{Gene Ontology Features}
\label{app:go}

Each feature used in the Gene Ontology feature represents an event where both proteins in the interaction have the same Gene Ontology term active.
If both are active the feature is 1, otherwise it is zero.
To select effective features, commonly occurring features in the active zone network were selected from each Gene Ontology domain.
These are summarised by domain and in the order used in the feature vectors in table \ref{apptab:go} for the first 10 of each domain.
The remaining terms are listed in table \ref{apptab:extrago}.
