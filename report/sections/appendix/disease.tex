\chapter{Disease enrichment results}

This appendix contains the results for disease enrichment between the weighted and unweighted graphs for the diseases Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's.
These can be found in tables \ref{tab:wdisease} and \ref{tab:uwdisease} for the weighted and unweighted results of the disease enrichment test, respectively.

%\section{Crossover membership test}
%%describing the test used to check which communities are most similar.
%
%This test was used to determine which of one group of communities was most similar to another community.
%Both communities can be expressed as a set of protein identifiers.
%Combining these sets we are left with a total set of all identifiers in either community.
%
%By iterating over this set and testing each identifier for membership in either set we obtain an array of boolean truth values.
%If the sets are identical, all of these will be true.
%These truth values can then be compared individually to find the number of shared members between each group.
