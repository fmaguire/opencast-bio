    This project focuses on the synaptic active zone network defined through experiments performed as part of the SYNSYS collaboration.
    Diverse data sources were used to appropriately weight the edges using a combination of a supervised binary classifier and a manually adjusted Naive Bayes model.
    A spectral modularity community detection algorithm was used to produce two sets of communities from the weighted and unweighted cases.
    The resulting communities were then compared using \ac{NMI} and in terms of disease association.
    Communities detected and disease associations within these differed between the weighted and unweighted cases.
