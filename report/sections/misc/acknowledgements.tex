    Firstly, I would like to acknowledge Colin Mclean as the main supervisor to this project and provided extensive input to both the implementation, planning and execution of all parts of the project.
    Finlay Maguire provided Biological expertise during this project, evaluating the theoretical basis behind many features and checking some of the code.
    As with the nature of this project, there were many databases and public resources that were used.
    These are described throughout the report and referenced appropriately.
    The project also made use of the Scikit-learn\autocite{pedregosa_scikit-learn:_2011} package throughout.
    Finally, this report was written using code developed by Chris Brown, Alex Shearn and Danilo Orlando.
