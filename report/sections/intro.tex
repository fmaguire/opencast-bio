\section{Motivation}

%expanded version of the above? need stats on depression and schizophrenia
It is estimated that disorders of the brain cost Europe €798 billion Euros in 2010\autocite{olesen_economic_2012}.
Specifically, depression is estimated to cost Europe €91.9 billion in 2004 and schizophrenia along with associated psychotic disorders is estimated at €93.9 billion.
There are many diseases with currently limited treatment options in the brain, and a deeper understanding of the brain is required to treat them.

These diseases are very likely to act at the synaptic level\autocites{chua_architecture_2010,synsys}.
However, the exact proteins or genes involved in these diseases are unknown.
If it is possible to even gain slightly more information about associated proteins at the synapse it may be possible to develop new treatments\autocite{li_interaction_2010}.

In addition, as a project this includes work from various areas, such as Bioinformatics, Machine Learning and Software Development that made it a good learning exercise.
It is a worthwhile investment in the fundamentals of constructing PPI networks.

\section{Outline}

% conclusion

This project involved combining both direct and indirect data sources to create weighted edges in a PPI graph to affect the communities detected by a Community Detection algorithm.
A flow chart describing this process and the elements involved is shown in figure \ref{fig:expflow}.
There are three main input sources shown, the pull-down experiments, direct data and indirect data.
Pull-down experiments were used to identify the proteins of interest, which were used to build an interaction network using direct data sources, such as interaction databases.
The indirect data sources, such as functional annotations of proteins, were used along with direct data sources in the process to generate weighted graphs.

The resulting weighted and unweighted PPI graphs were then separated into communities using a Community Detection algorithm.
These communities could then be compared using the two methods named in figure \ref{fig:expflow}: Disease Enrichment and NMI.
The results of these tested the hypothesis of the project.

%hypothesis required
The hypothesis of this project was that the communities detected in each case would differ and that these differences would be relevant to the conclusions each network could illustrate about a particular disease.
NMI was able to show simply that the two sets of communities detected was different.
Disease enrichment refers to testing the likelihood that a given community is involved in a particular disease.
This allowed us to show the differences in the predictions for disease involvement given by each network due to the weighting of the networks.

%structure of the report and other resources
The report first describes the background knowledge driving the hypothesis of the project in chapter \ref{background}.
In chapter \ref{methods} the methods involved in executing the project are described.
Finally, the results obtained are described in chapter \ref{results}.
In addition, the execution of all commands required to reproduce the project were recorded in notebooks described in section \ref{app:notebooks}.
This project was stored in a git repository and is publicly available in a repository described in Appendix \ref{app:repository}.

%should also mention the prototype run through and which week it occurred in 

\section*{Conclusion}

The following report covers the background information necessary to understand the methods of the project and the results which were obtained.
It was approached as an opportunity to use a variety of new tools, and each will be described as the report continues.
