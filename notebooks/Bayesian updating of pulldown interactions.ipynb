      "The problem with weighting the interactions in the curated edgelist we are using to build our protein-protein interaction network is that the classifier is not perfect and is supplying extremely low probabilities for interactions which we expect to exist.\n",
      "We can encode this prior into our model by considering inclusion in the edgelist and the result of classification to both be events that are dependent on an underlying interaction event.\n",
      "This describes the following Bayesian network:\n",

      "By continuing with our assumption that any interaction given more than 50% confidence by the HIPPIE database is a real interaction we can then solve for the parameters that describe the conditional distributions.\n",
