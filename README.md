opencast-bio
============

A biological data mining project as part of a Masters degree at the University of Edinburgh.

-----------------------------------

There are three parts to this project.
Firstly, we're trying to replicate and build on previous work in the area of protein interaction prediction.
Secondly, applying various different supervised classification algorithms to this data as a machine learning exercise.
Thirdly, Using this classification algorithm to build a weighted graph to see if the weighted graph can improve the performance of a community detection algorithm used at the University of Edinburgh.

For detailed information about the proposed project, look at the [proposal][].

# Required packages

All that's required for most of this code is pylab and Scikit-learn. For a full list of all possible requirements and their versions look at the notebook on [required packages][reqnotes]

# Progress

This project has completed.
The report is available in the repository.
